\title{Generate Monte Carlo Cross-Validation (MCCV) Training Indices}
\usage{
.mc(k, Y, split)
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{Integer. Number of MCCV iterations (i.e., training sets to generate).}

\item{Y}{A matrix (n x p), where rows are observations and columns are outcomes. Only the number of rows is used here.}

\item{split}{Numeric. Fraction of the data to include in each training set. Should be between 0 and 1.}
}
\value{
A list of length \code{k}, each containing a vector of training set indices.
}
\description{
Generates a list of training set indices for Monte Carlo Cross-Validation.
}
\details{
For each fold, a random sample (with replacement) of size \code{floor(nrow(Y) * split)} is drawn.
