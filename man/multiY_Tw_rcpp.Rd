\title{Summarise Multivariate Y Weights via PCA}
\usage{
multiY_Tw_rcpp(X, Y, it_max, eps)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix (n × p): predictor matrix.}

\item{Y}{A numeric matrix (n × k): response matrix with k variables.}

\item{it_max}{Maximum nb of iterations for NIPALS converge.}

\item{eps}{Threshold for sum of squares quotient below which NIPALS is considered converged}
}
\value{
A matrix (p × r) of PCA scores, where r is the number of retained components.
}
\description{
Computes X-weight vectors for each response variable in a multivariate outcome matrix \code{Y},
then performs PCA on these weights to extract shared predictive structure.
Useful when \code{Y} has multiple columns (e.g., for multiclass problems).
Conecptually similar to Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Multiblock PLS.
}
\details{
The function first computes weights for each column in \code{Y} using least-squares projection,
forming a weight matrix \code{W_x}. PCA is then applied to this matrix using NIPALS,
and score components are extracted until the explained variance ratio drops below a threshold.
}
\examples{
# Simulate data: 30 samples, 10 predictors, 3 response variables
set.seed(123)
X <- matrix(rnorm(30 * 10), nrow = 30)
Y <- matrix(rnorm(30 * 3), nrow = 30)
# Compute multivariate Y weights via PCA
T_w <- multiY_Tw_rcpp(X, Y, it_max = 50, eps = 1e-4)
