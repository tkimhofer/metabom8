\title{#' @title Orthogonal Partial Least Squares (O-PLS)
#'
#' @description
#' Fits an Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures (O-PLS) model for regression or classification.
#' The number of orthogonal components is automatically selected using internal cross-validation.
#' To avoid underfitting, components are added incrementally, while overfitting is prevented by requiring
that each new component improves predictive performance beyond a defined threshold (ΔQ² / ΔAUROC > 0.05).
This ensures the model captures relevant structure without modelling noise or irrelevant variation.}
\usage{
opls(
  X,
  Y,
  center = TRUE,
  scale = "UV",
  cv = list(method = "k-fold_stratified", k = 7, split = 2/3),
  maxPCo = 5,
  plotting = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Numeric matrix or data frame of predictors. Rows are samples; columns are features.}

\item{Y}{Response variable. Vector or matrix. For classification, should be a factor or class labels; for regression, a numeric vector or matrix.}

\item{center}{Logical. Should features be mean-centered? Default is TRUE.}

\item{scale}{Character. Scaling method. Supported: "None", "UV" (unit variance), or "Pareto".}

\item{cv}{Named list specifying cross-validation settings: method ("k-fold", "k-fold_stratified"), split (training set proportion), and k (number of folds).}

\item{maxPCo}{Integer. Maximum number of orthogonal components to consider. Default is 5.}

\item{plotting}{Logical. If TRUE, shows model summary plot.}
}
\value{
An S4 object of class OPLS_metabom8.
