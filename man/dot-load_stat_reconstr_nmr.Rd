\title{Correlation and Covariance of Scores with NMR Data}
\usage{
.load_stat_reconstr_nmr(mod, pc, X, idx, ppm)
}
\arguments{
\item{mod}{An object of class \code{PCA_metabom8} or \code{OPLS_metabom8}.}

\item{pc}{Character or numeric. Component identifier (e.g., \code{1}, \code{"o1"}).}

\item{X}{Numeric matrix. NMR spectra matrix (samples x variables).}

\item{idx}{Integer vector. Indices specifying the region of interest in the chemical shift vector.}

\item{ppm}{Numeric vector. Chemical shift values (ppm).}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{cor}{Absolute correlation between model scores and spectral intensities.}
\item{cov}{Covariance between model scores and spectral intensities.}
\item{ppm}{Chemical shift values (ppm).}
}
}
\description{
Computes the correlation and covariance between model component scores and NMR spectral variables.
This is typically used to reconstruct statistical relevance maps (e.g., statistical total correlation spectroscopy, STOCSY-like plots).
}
\details{
Correlations are computed as Pearson coefficients between the selected component's scores and each spectral variable across samples.
Covariances are similarly computed. This provides insight into variables driving component separation.

\examples{
# df <- .load_stat_reconstr_nmr(model, "1", X, get_idx(c(0.5, 4.5), ppm), ppm)
