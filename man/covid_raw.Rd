\description{
1D proton NMR spectra from SARS-CoV-2–positive patients (n = 10) and healthy controls (n = 13),
collected in a research study in Perth, Western Australia. Spectra are raw and require processing
before statistical analysis (see \code{?covid} for processed spectra).
}
\details{
FIDs were acquired using a Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence on a 600 MHz Bruker
Avance II spectrometer using IVDr methods for blood plasma (300 K, 32 scans). The spectrometer was
equipped with a double-resonance broadband (BBI) probe and a refrigerated autosampler at
4\eqn{^{\circ}}C.
