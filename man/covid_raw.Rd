\description{
1D proton NMR spectra from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n=10) and healthy controls (n=13), collected in a research study in Perth, Western Australia. Spectra are raw and require processing before statistical analysis (see \code{?covid} for processed spectra).
FIDs were acquired using a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence on a 600 MHz Avance II spectrometer using Bruker IVDr methods for blood plasma (300 K, 32 scans). The spectrometer was equipped with a double resonance broadband probe (BBI) and a refrigerated autosampler at 4ËšC.
