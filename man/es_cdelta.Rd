\title{Cliff's Delta Effect Size}
\usage{
es_cdelta(ref, comp)
}
\arguments{
\item{ref}{Numeric vector representing the reference group.}

\item{comp}{Numeric vector representing the comparator group.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value: Cliff's delta.
}
\description{
Calculates Cliff's delta, a non-parametric effect size that quantifies the degree of overlap between two distributions. The value ranges from -1 to 1, where:
\itemize{
\item{-1: all values in \code{comp} are greater than those in \code{ref}}
\item{0: complete overlap between distributions}
\item{1: all values in \code{ref} are greater than those in \code{comp}}
}
}
\details{
The effect size is calculated as the scaled difference in dominance between groups.
Missing or infinite values are removed with a message.

\examples{
ref <- rnorm(100, mean = 0)
comp <- rnorm(100, mean = 1)
es_cdelta(ref, comp)
